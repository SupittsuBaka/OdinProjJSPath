    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Caesar salad is such a classic. Want a crow-pleasing appetizer?
        Caesar salad. Looking for a light meal? Caesar salad (plus your
        favorite protein). Just want something quick and easy?
        Four-ingredient Caesar salad it is.</p>
    <p> While picking up a bottle of store-bought Caesar dressing may
        work in a pinch, nothing beats a homemade Caesar salad. The
        fresh lettuce, crunchy croutons, savory dressing, and delicious
        cheese create the perfect combination that's surprisingly simple
        to throw together.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place
            bread on a rimmed baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together oil, butter, garlic, salt, and pepper in a
            liquid measure. Pour mixture over the bread and toss with
            your hands until evenly coated. Spread bread mixture into
            a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until golden
            brown and toasted, yet slightly soft in the center, 15 to
            18 minutes, tossing croutons a few times during baking.
            Remove from the oven and let cool completely while you
            prepare the salad.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place garlic, anchovies, and salt in a large salad serving
            bowl; press the mixture with a fork until a paste forms.
            Stir in egg yolk, lemon juice, Dijon, and Worcestershire
            sauce until well combined. Slowly whisk in olive oil until
            all is incorporated and mixture is well blended and smooth.
            Stir in 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
            Remove about 1/4 cup of dressing and set aside for another use.
        </li>
        <li>
            When ready to serve, add lettuce and 1/2 of the croutons to
            the bowl with the remaining dressing; toss until well coated.
            Reserve remaining croutons for another use.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle salad with additional Parmesan and pepper if desired.
            Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These soft-boiled, marinated eggs are perfect to add to your
        ramen soup. I was given this recipe by the owner of a great
        little ramen shop I stopped at for lunch one day. The eggs
        turn out beautifully every time.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>
            Marinade:
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring eggs to room temperature by soaking them in warm water
            for about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack.
            Gently lower eggs into the boiling water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently lower eggs into water and boil for 6 minutes 20
            seconds. Remove eggs and place in a bowl of ice water until
            completely cool, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the eggs are cooling, stir together soy sauce, mirin,
            sake, and pepper for marinade in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of
            the shell and work you way up and down.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least
            2 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning
            eggs every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice eggs in half when ready to use.
        </li>
    </ol>
